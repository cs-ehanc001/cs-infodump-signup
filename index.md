# Computer Science Infodump Signup

The Computer Science Infodump event is an event hosted by the Neurodivergent Monarchs in which the goal is to give people the chance to infodump (simply put, to give a lot of information really quickly) about any computer science topic in front of an interested audience. This event will have presenters throughout the entire event, and people can listen to any talks they are interested in.

This event will take place on Thursday, November 21st from 5-7pm in Library Learning Commons Room 1310.

You can register for a 10-minute, 20-minute, or 30-minute time slot using the link below. You can allocate this time as you wish- if you want to speak for 8 minutes and leave 2 for questions, that's fine. If you want to speak the whole way through, that's fine as well. Visual aids are permitted but not required-- the point of these talks is to give you an opportunity to ramble about a computer science topic you enjoy, not necessarily to teach a lesson or concept.

You are not obligated to follow traditional rules of presentation (ex. consistent eye contact with the audience).

If you have a slideshow, please email it to zwasi001@odu.edu by 4pm November 21st with the subject line "\[Last Name\] CS Infodump Presentation".

You can reach out to Zara at zwasi001@odu.edu or Adam at amand009@odu.edu with any questions.
